# Club Admin

Club Admin (working title) is an app that helps people who run clubs/meetups take attendance and keep notes on members for better engagement.

I'm making this because a) I'm tired of keeping attendance in a Google spreadsheet and b) my memory is terrible and I forget members' faces and names even if they attend almost every meetup.
